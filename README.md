# QlikSense_BrowserZoom
An extension for Qlik Sense to resize the dashboard with a browser-like zoom effect

When you use several extensions in qlik sense, some rearrengement issues can arise when the page is seen on smaller devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Due to its responsive nature Qlik arranges the dashboard's component in a bootstrap-like manner. This can eventually yield awkward designs with smaller extensions such as tile menus ancd checkboxes.

Qlik Sense BrowserZoom is here to get rid of this problem, by resizing the zoom level of each element, so that it can fit the new device better.

The action is triggered when the browser's window is resized.
You can also adjust the zoom level by using the green buttons.
Enjoy!
